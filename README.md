This is base on the original bunker folder available [here](https://github.com/agilexrobotics/ugv_gazebo_sim). 
The main difference is that this is using different plugin for moving, we have the target to replicate the behaviour of a real tracked vehicle on this robot.

Please note: this is not the final version of the packages we will update. The repository is public just for convinient.
